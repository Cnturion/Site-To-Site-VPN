# Site-To-Site-VPN
Site to site VPN between AWS Commercial Cloud and GovCloud. This demonstration can also be applied to an on-premises infrastructure.

Recently, I was presented with a challenge that initially seemed like an easy task but ended up taking me 5-7 days to figure out. In this repository, I want to demonstrate the process of setting up a Site-to-Site VPN from AWS Cloud to AWS GovCloud. This demo can also be applied to those who would like to establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection between AWS Cloud and their on-premises infrastructure. Additionally, and most importantly, I would like to highlight some common errors that you may encounter when trying to establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection. Personally, these errors took me days to troubleshoot because they were not easy to find solutions for.

First, I would like to thank the AWS community for their participation in helping me find a solution to this challenge and their mentorship.
